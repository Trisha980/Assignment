    <h1>Abner Doubleday</h1>
    <p>"Abner Doubleday (June 26, 1819 â€“ January 26, 1893)[1] was a career United States Army
        officer and Union major general in the American Civil War. He fired the first shot in
        defense of Fort Sumter, the opening battle of the war, and had a pivotal role in the early
        fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg. Gettysburg was his finest hour, but his relief by
        Maj. Gen. George G. Meade caused lasting enmity between the two men. In San Francisco,
        after the war, he obtained a patent on the cable car railway that still runs there.
        In his final years in New Jersey, he was a prominent member and later president of the
        Theosophical Society."</p>
    <p>"In 1908, fifteen years after his death, Doubleday was declared by the Mills Commission
        to have invented the game of baseball (a claim never made by Doubleday during his lifetime).
        This claim has been thoroughly debunked by baseball historians."</p>
    <p>Although Doubleday achieved minor fame as a competent combat general with experience in many
        important Civil War battles, he is more widely known as the supposed inventor of the game of baseball,
        in Elihu Phinney's cow pasture in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839.</p>
