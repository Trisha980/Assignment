<h1>Introducing Baseball</h1>
<p>“The question of who originated the game “Baseball” has been the subject of debate and controversy for more than a century.”1 But one fact remains is that Baseball is developed from folk games early in Britain and Continental Europe. People say, a young man named Abner Doubleday invented “Baseball” in Cooperstown, New York, during summer in 1893. In the same year, Doubleday became a Civil War hero, while Baseball slowly became known in America. Not only does this story is untrue, Doubleday was still at West Point in 1893, and he never claimed anything to do about baseball. The true story turned out to be a little more complicated. “References to games resembling baseball in the United States date back to the 18th century.”1 The game cricket and rounders (a game for children brought to New England by earliest colonist) said to be the most direct ancestors.</p>
